# Jumping-on-the-Clouds-algo
This code solves the Jumping on the Clouds problem by figuring out the fewest jumps needed to reach the end while avoiding thunderclouds. It always tries to make the longest jump possible, which is 2 steps, when it’s safe. If that’s not an option, it takes a single step instead. It counts the jumps until it reaches the last cloud.
